Creating a WhatsApp Notification Service Using AWS Lambda and a Serverless Framework
WhatsAppPush, LLC, is an SaaS (Software as a Service)-based solutions for customers that allows them to automate the overall notification process at Whatsapp and enable personalized communications with different users worldwide in real-time. In this liveProject, you will be a Backend Engineer responsible for the overall design and development of a cloud-based SaaS application using modern programming languages and toolsets.

Imagine you have a customer for WhatsAppPush. That customer wants to send a reminder message for their booked appointments via the Whatsapp channel to their clients. The customer is a tutor running an online class about a particular language. The class consists of hundreds of students, and the tutor needs to send the reminder message to each student. It would be tedious and error prone for the tutor to search for each student manually and send the reminder message. In addition, it would also be difficult for the tutor to check manually to see if the messages were delivered to each recipient.

To eliminate this issue and automate the overall process, I, as a backend engineer at WhatsAppPush, will be designing a solution where the tutor can upload a single file in the form of CSV or XLSX that would contain the first name and mobile number of each student. Additionally, I will be implementing another functionality that allows users to keep track of the delivery status of these broadcast messages.
